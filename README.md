# Greedy Gamble

Greedy Gamble is a Decentralized Flutter app which involves two players depositing a specified amount to gamble over the flip of a coin, whoever wins gets credited the total sum of both the accounts and the loser loses all the amount. The amount of both the players is stored on a local blockchain network and the players can keep testing their luck by depositing the desired amount on the basis of their mutual agreement.
